All of the code I have been working on for the current RNAsequencing transcriptomic project of Arterial/Venous muscle samples. 

RNAseq_practice: Practice code prepapred on a mock data set. Learning to use DESeq2 for gene expression analysis, PCA plots, Volcanos & Heatmaps etc...

RNAseq_AVproject: "Real" data analysis code. All the way from initial QC steps, filtering, exploration of different normalzation techniques to running the DGE and visualizing its results thereafter. Also includes the use of Limma package due to a more complex, multifactorial study design
