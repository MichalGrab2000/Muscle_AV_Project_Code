All of the code I have been working on for the current RNAsequencing transcriptomic project of Arterial/Venous muscle samples. 

GSEA: Prepared pipeline to run a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 

RNAseq_practice: Practice code prepapred on a mock data set. Learning to use DESeq2 for gene expression analysis, PCA plots, Volcanos & Heatmaps etc...

RNAseq_AVproject: "Real" data analysis code. Also includes the use of Limma package due to a more complex, multifactorial study design
